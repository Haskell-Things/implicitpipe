# GPipe-Test

This is a simple example of how to use the new GPipe API with the GPipe-GLFW
backend. This example has been lifted almost verbatim from
[GPipe is dead, long live GPipe!](http://tobbebex.blogspot.com/2015/09/gpipe-is-dead-long-live-gpipe.html).

## GPipe

**GPipe** is a typesafe functional API based on the conceptual model of OpenGL,
but without the imperative state machine.

To learn GPipe, start with the
[readme](https://github.com/tobbebex/GPipe-Core#readme). You could also go
directly to [a working example](https://github.com/plredmond/GPipe-Test)
